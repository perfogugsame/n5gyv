In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Abigail The Advocate has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016. Abigail The Advocate has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
